# **Facial Recognition Demo**

This interactive face detection sample takes in a video file and recognizes a human face within the frame and provides insight into the
face's characteristics. It runs 3 recognition models - facial recogntion, age/gender recognition, and emotion recognition providing live
insight into how old the people are, whether they are male or female, and what emotion their faces are displaying. 

Here is a snapshot of the demo run on an image:
